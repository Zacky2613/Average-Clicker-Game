# Average-Clicker-Game
Average Clicker Game (AVG) is a Python clicker game not made with pygame but with tkinter, it has worker, worker upgrades, times click upgardes, settings, save system, etc.
I regret making it with .pack instead of .grid because I could've made the ui look much nicer but changing it would mean rewriting and fixing the entire game and I'm not up to that
