# Average-Clicker-Game
Average Clicker Game (AVG) is a Python clicker game not made with pygame but with tkinter, it has worker, worker upgrades, times click upgardes, settings, save system, etc.
I regret making it with .pack instead of .grid because I could've made the ui look much nicer but changing it would mean rewriting and fixing the entire game and I'm not up to that so if you want to you can go do that.
