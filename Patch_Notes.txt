Welcome to Verion 2.2.0! I've added a few things..:

- Save system (finally)
- Settings has stuff now (Credits, Stats, reset Stats, Manual Save Button)
- New Shop Page
- New workers (Razor Mouse and Off-Brand autoclicker)
- New shop item Worker Upgrades (only 1 for each so far)
- Sorry to break the news but the current method I use to sort the buttons out (.pack()) makes it so I can't put another button on the same line unless I use .grid() (I tried to change it over but I'll need the basically make a new game for it to work)
- Increased Window size
- New shop design, lot more compacted but shows more upgrade + page system
- Lots more little things I've forgot


What to expect next update: // I don't know if I'll make a update so don't expect this.

- A rebirth system
- 5th Worker or 2nd Upgrades (high chance for both)
- More stuff in settings
- Maybe a program built into the program to make it easier to send emails.

Found Bugs? Email the email in settings!


Dev Note(s): -The game is 800+ lines of code except at least a few bugs unless I'm a fucking god at programming,
             also once I've done the last few tweaks and updates I'll release it on github for all to see my horrible code writing.


THIS PROGRAM IS SAFE! Windows defender or your anti-virus might think this is a virus or a threat THIS IS A FALSE POSTIVE, it's 100% safe with no malicous code behind it whatsoever // This is talking about the .exe (in the .zip file) I made which causes a false postive for windows defender
